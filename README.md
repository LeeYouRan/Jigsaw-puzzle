# Jigsaw-puzzle

Use Python to write a Jigsaw puzzle game demo.

Pintu.exe is a packaged executable. 

Notice, it's not completely packed. 

You need to download the resource directory and subfiles and place them in the same directory as the exe file to run properly. 

This is for easy customization of fonts and images.
